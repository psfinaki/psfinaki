### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at the F# language team in Microsoft.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d be happy to collaborate on things that bring something good to this world.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about F#, .NET, and testing. I like to help and have an active StackOverflow [profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3232646/psfinaki).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petrsimonek/).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been writing down my dreams for about 10 years already, a lot of fun and surreal stuff there.
